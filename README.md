# heteroglyphs
A list and some code for non-confusable non-homoglyphs for use when humans need to enter unique codes.

Homoglyphs, also known as homographs or confusables, are characters that look similar though the similarity may depend on the typeface.

Some examples:

* 0/O
* 1/l/I
* A/Ａ (the second character looking like an ASCII 'a' is actually a unicode Latin Ａ)

Confusables are particularly nasty for situations where a person needs to enter a product code (think: Windows serial numbers).

In an effort to maximize the number of characters one can use and minimize human errors, here are the ASCII non-confusables, henceforth known as nonfusables.
